### Disclaimer
By using this software, you acknowledge that it’s all for fun and games—literally. While the developer hopes you enjoy the thrills of Blackjack, Poker, and Roulette, they are not responsible if you start thinking you're the next big casino mogul. This program is intended for entertainment purposes only. If you find yourself staying up until 3 AM placing virtual bets (or worse—betting your life savings on online Monopoly), remember: it's all fictional, and the developer is not liable for any newfound gambling habits, compulsive Vegas fantasies, or strange urges to wear a tuxedo at your next family BBQ.

Gambling can be addictive, and if you find yourself more interested in your winning streak than, say, your job, your friends, or your pets, it might be time to take a break. The developer disclaims any liability for gambling addiction, financial ruin, or any other consequences that may arise from playing this game, including but not limited to: spontaneous trips to Vegas, uncontrollable urges to buy a casino-themed bathrobe, or an unhealthy obsession with counting cards at the grocery store.

Please gamble responsibly. This software is here to entertain, not to bankroll your dream of owning a private island.
